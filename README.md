# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this study guide webpage was to provide notes and information to new coding bootcamp students such as myself. What motivated me to work on this project was to understand coding basics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and apply that to real world scenarios. I learned the basics of coding and how to use Git, and Github repositories so that I am familiar with everything by the time classes start.
